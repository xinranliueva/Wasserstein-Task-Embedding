# Wasserstein Task Embedding for Measuring Task Similarities

This repository provides the implementation of [WTE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11726) framework on CPU device. WTE is a model-agnostic task embedding framework for measuring task (dis)similarities in supervised classification problems, with linear computational cost with respect to number of tasks.

## Datasets: 
- torchvision datasets: MNIST, EMNIST, FashionMNIST, KMNIST, USPS and CIFAR100
- [Tiny ImageNet](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/tiny-imagenet-200.zip)

## Code:
- ```demo_NIST.ipynb```: notebook to reproduce WTE distances for *NIST task group.
